# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: May 06, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created this repository as a base to work from 

**Thoughts:** This repository is bootstrapped using create-react-app and tailwind cdn. I later need to see how I can get typescript added, especially that it works in codesandbox

**Link to work:** see App.js for now

### Day 1: May 07, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Add Typescript 

**Thoughts:** It was rather tricky to add typescript after bootstrapping, it required a number of stackoverflow searches for different config options to add to sconfig.js and package.json to silence a number of eslint errors

**Link to work:** see App.js for now

### Day 2: May 08, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Play with Tailwind to style a navbar

**Thoughts:** Tailwind is great for styling, using the emmet abbreviations makes it a breeze, albeit slightly cryptic at first. And remember to store your images in public folder not src, otherwise it doesn't render correctly.

Link to work: WIP, coming soon

### Day 3: May 09, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took on coding challenge, maximum square from Leet code

**Thoughts:** This is a dynamic programming challenge which expects a bottom-up (tabulation) problem solving strategy, supposedly liked by a number of the FAANG companies.

### Day 4: May 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** add a hero section to 100 Days code profile

**Thoughts:** Adding a favicon was really straightforrward, I am continually amazed at how easy tailwind makes styling with flex layout

### Day 5: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tailwind utility classes, using flex layouts

**Thoughts:** Flex layout is great for single dimensional styling, and using tailwind you get specatular layouts for relatively little effort.

### Day 6: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Brainy notes today, using Formik and Yup for form validation

**Thoughts:** Using Formik is a great abstraction for form creation in React.

### Day 7: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Migrated from Hasura to Supabase in my notetaking app, remarkebly easy. Sorry Hasura I will be back, just a little detour

**Thoughts:** Hasura feels overly complex, for my needs I think supabase might be a better fit

### Day 8: May 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Add React-router to 100 Days app. Next thing will be migrating to Remix, üíØ ‚öõÔ∏è	

**Thoughts:** React router has kept up with progress, I like it

### Day 9: May 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Struggled to hit the one hour mark, studied Typescript...	

**Thoughts:** I can se why they call it 100 day challenge, I feel there will be dips like this in completing challenges, which is why its called 100 day challenge. Onwards and upwards.

### Day 14: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Working on Brainynotes again, using useRef with useLayoutEffect very effect[ive] lol.

**Thoughts:** Having component abstractions sometimes interferes with the React core logic, not passing props through properly

Link to work: Brainy notes

### Day 15: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took some time learning basics of NextJS, Dynamic routes, and Image tags working on my Leeny LMS project

**Thoughts:** Dynamic routing is a powerful abstraction for serving CMS content easily

### Day 16: May 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Back to algos, picking Python as language of choice for solving algo/DS type challenges, its such a nice succint language.

**Thoughts:** Having two languages under ones belt is a good thing, covers much wider territory in terms of what one can achieve.

### Day 17 May 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Back to basics, Python basics to be exact, solving algo/DS problems feels more intuitive. 

**Thoughts:** Having two languages under ones belt is a good thing, covers much wider territory in terms of what one can achieve.

### Day 18 May 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Re-doing the Structy course, this time using python, one realises how compact Python is, üòè. https://www.structy.net/

**Thoughts:** I think I will use python as my language of choice for coding interviews, and javascript for purely technical frontend discussions

Link to work: https://www.structy.net/

### Day 19 May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Working through structy problems using Python is really refreshing. Python is such a nice succinct language for comprehension of intent.

**Thoughts:** Python for coding interview and js/ts for web apps

### Day 20 May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Linked list time. First learn how to code up a standard Linked list traversal Algo used for many Linked list type coding questions

**Thoughts:** not sure where I might use a Linked list in the wild tbh

Link to work: coding patterns

### Day 21 May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Reading the typescript handbook, for second time. Amazing how little details suddenly click. 

**Thoughts:** This typescript business is great

### Day 22 May 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Rediscovered Redux, and Redux toolkit, Wow, and Learn with Jason and Mark Erikson just such a nice video tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Redux is made so much simpler with the smart design choices and abstractions made by the maintainers 

Link to work: nothing to see


### Day 23 May 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Sticking with implementing Redux in my notes app, amazing how sensible the redux toolkit defaults are

### Day 25 30 May 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today i learnt you can avoid the ../../components spiel by adding the baseUrl key with value of " ./src" to tsconfig.json, even in a JS project. Little things, but little things add up. Thanks
**Thoughts:** keep these stored somewhere, brainy notes maybe...

### Day 26 31 May 2022

**Today's Progress:** More Redux

**Thoughts:** Need to get MVP of Brainy notes out.

 ### Day 27 01 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Creating fake apis using fakerjs and redux to test my note taking app locally. I see fakerjs has some interesting suggested domain names.

**Thoughts:** Make sure you document how setup a boiler plate for generating fake data in form of lists etc.

### Day 28 02 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked a lot with tailwindcss today, Not being a CSS guy, I feel like I have CSS superpowers thanks to wonderful abstractions and of course the wonderful @simonswiss screencasts.

**Thoughts:** Try to document, and remember the patterns you follow for repeated styling needs, such as center div's, adding shadow etc. etc.

Link to work: TODO: Later today, when you commit your work copy the commit link here and then tweet about it. Following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jix4KyxLuQ&t=133s 

### Day 29 03 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Spending the day doing the Redux song and dance, Redux Toolkit makes it feel like one really is dancing across the codebase to get CRUD added all over the place. #Elegant #ReduxToolkit   

**Thoughts:** Add this core routine of createSlice, add reducer, useAppSelector... to your developer notes

Link to work: Brainy notes


### Day 30 04 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** I love typescript, but because I don't yet know it well enough it just gets in the way when doing js based tutorial. Feeling slighlty ashamed to be renaming my txs files back to js and globally declare module to escape the Typescript pain.    

**Thoughts:** Learn typescript

Link to work: Brainy notes

### Day 31 05 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** To make up for yesterday's typescript failings trying to type redux reducers I am spending hour of code today reading the typescript handbook. 
**Thoughts:** Learn typescript

Link to work: Brainy notes

### Day 32 06 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** more Typescript. Learning generics today. I learnt another name for them is type parameters and Type Parameters they Should Appear at least twice to be useful, binding input and output of function calls.

**Thoughts:** Learn typescript

Link to work: 

### Day 33 07 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Redux Thunks, trickier then I thought. Need to get the patterns down pat for the redux sing and dance. 

**Thoughts:** Learn async

Link to work: 

### Day 34 08 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** More of the same, Async Redux. The convention over configuration in @ReduxjsToolkit is great, albeit slighlty trickier to get under the hood of whats going on for learning purposes.  

**Thoughts:** Learn async

### Day 35 09 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** been using git for a while but this video really hits home to correct use of git best practices. https://youtu.be/f-Br8cud2eI  

**Thoughts:** Learn atomic commits

Link to work: 

### Day 36 10 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** Typescript day. Long way to go grokking typescript after skimming the typescript handbook

**Thoughts:** focus on the details

Link to work: 

### Day 37 11 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** More Redux fundamentals, learning all the building blocks that make up the redux pattern.

**Thoughts:** focus on the details

Link to work: 

### Day 38 12 June 2022

**Today's Progress:** So today I went down the Redux rabbit hole, who would of thought so much could be packed into one topic, convention over configuration, immutability, higher order functions, data normalization, cache invalidation, and the list goes on. The excellent @reduxjs docs make it a pleasure to learn though.

**Thoughts:** focus on the details
