# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: May 06, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created this repository as a base to work from 

**Thoughts:** This repository is bootstrapped using create-react-app and tailwind cdn. I later need to see how I can get typescript added, especially that it works in codesandbox

**Link to work:** see App.js for now

### Day 1: May 07, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Add Typescript 

**Thoughts:** It was rather tricky to add typescript after bootstrapping, it required a number of stackoverflow searches for different config options to add to sconfig.js and package.json to silence a number of eslint errors

**Link to work:** see App.js for now

### Day 2: May 08, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Play with Tailwind to style a navbar

**Thoughts:** Tailwind is great for styling, using the emmet abbreviations makes it a breeze, albeit slightly cryptic at first. And remember to store your images in public folder not src, otherwise it doesn't render correctly.

Link to work: WIP, coming soon

### Day 3: May 09, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took on coding challenge, maximum square from Leet code

**Thoughts:** This is a dynamic programming challenge which expects a bottom-up (tabulation) problem solving strategy, supposedly liked by a number of the FAANG companies.

### Day 4: May 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** add a hero section to 100 Days code profile

**Thoughts:** Adding a favicon was really straightforrward, I am continually amazed at how easy tailwind makes styling with flex layout

### Day 5: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tailwind utility classes, using flex layouts

**Thoughts:** Flex layout is great for single dimensional styling, and using tailwind you get specatular layouts for relatively little effort.

### Day 6: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Brainy notes today, using Formik and Yup for form validation

**Thoughts:** Using Formik is a great abstraction for form creation in React.

### Day 7: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Migrated from Hasura to Supabase in my notetaking app, remarkebly easy. Sorry Hasura I will be back, just a little detour

**Thoughts:** Hasura feels overly complex, for my needs I think supabase might be a better fit

### Day 8: May 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Add React-router to 100 Days app. Next thing will be migrating to Remix, üíØ ‚öõÔ∏è	

**Thoughts:** React router has kept up with progress, I like it

### Day 9: May 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Struggled to hit the one hour mark, studied Typescript...	

**Thoughts:** I can se why they call it 100 day challenge, I feel there will be dips like this in completing challenges, which is why its called 100 day challenge. Onwards and upwards.

### Day 10: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Algos all the way, maximum subsquare problem	

**Thoughts:** It's tough

### Day 11: May 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Algos all the way, dp (dfs + memoization)	

**Thoughts:** It's tough

### Day 12: May 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Scrolling through the Algomonster selection of coding challenges from different FAANG companies	

**Thoughts:** It's tough

### Day 14: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Working on Brainynotes again, using useRef with useLayoutEffect very effect[ive] lol.

**Thoughts:** Having component abstractions sometimes interferes with the React core logic, not passing props through properly

### Day 15: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took some time learning basics of NextJS, Dynamic routes, and Image tags working on my Leeny LMS project

**Thoughts:** Dynamic routing is a powerful abstraction for serving CMS content easily

### Day 16: May 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Back to algos, picking Python as language of choice for solving algo/DS type challenges, its such a nice succint language.

**Thoughts:** Having two languages under ones belt is a good thing, covers much wider territory in terms of what one can achieve.

### Day 17 May 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Back to basics, Python basics to be exact, solving algo/DS problems feels more intuitive. 

**Thoughts:** Having two languages under ones belt is a good thing, covers much wider territory in terms of what one can achieve.

### Day 18 May 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Re-doing the Structy course, this time using python, one realises how compact Python is, üòè. https://www.structy.net/

**Thoughts:** I think I will use python as my language of choice for coding interviews, and javascript for purely technical frontend discussions

Link to work: https://www.structy.net/

### Day 19 May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Working through structy problems using Python is really refreshing. Python is such a nice succinct language for comprehension of intent.

**Thoughts:** Python for coding interview and js/ts for web apps

### Day 20 May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Linked list time. First learn how to code up a standard Linked list traversal Algo used for many Linked list type coding questions

**Thoughts:** not sure where I might use a Linked list in the wild tbh
