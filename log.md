# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: May 06, 2022

Today's Progress: Created this repository as a base to work from 

Thoughts: This repository is bootstrapped using create-react-app and tailwind cdn. I later need to see how I can get typescript added, especially that it works in codesandbox

Link to work: see App.js for now

### Day 1: May 07, 2022

Today's Progress: Add Typescript 

Thoughts: It was rather tricky to add typescript after bootstrapping, it required a number of stackoverflow searches for different config options to add to sconfig.js and package.json to silence a number of eslint errors
