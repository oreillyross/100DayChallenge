# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: May 06, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created this repository as a base to work from 

**Thoughts:** This repository is bootstrapped using create-react-app and tailwind cdn. I later need to see how I can get typescript added, especially that it works in codesandbox

**Link to work:** see App.js for now

### Day 1: May 07, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Add Typescript 

**Thoughts:** It was rather tricky to add typescript after bootstrapping, it required a number of stackoverflow searches for different config options to add to sconfig.js and package.json to silence a number of eslint errors

**Link to work:** see App.js for now

### Day 2: May 08, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Play with Tailwind to style a navbar

**Thoughts:** Tailwind is great for styling, using the emmet abbreviations makes it a breeze, albeit slightly cryptic at first. And remember to store your images in public folder not src, otherwise it doesn't render correctly.

Link to work: WIP, coming soon

### Day 3: May 09, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took on coding challenge, maximum square from Leet code

**Thoughts:** This is a dynamic programming challenge which expects a bottom-up (tabulation) problem solving strategy, supposedly liked by a number of the FAANG companies.

### Day 4: May 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** add a hero section to 100 Days code profile

**Thoughts:** Adding a favicon was really straightforrward, I am continually amazed at how easy tailwind makes styling with flex layout

### Day 5: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tailwind utility classes, using flex layouts

**Thoughts:** Flex layout is great for single dimensional styling, and using tailwind you get specatular layouts for relatively little effort.
