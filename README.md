# 100 Day Challenge

#### My motivation for this challenge is taken from [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

During my 100 days of coding I have taken on the challenge of completing a note taking app written in React, Typescript, using Redux as the front end state management library, React router for routing and Supabase for backend instant api.
